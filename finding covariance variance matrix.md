# Variance
This measures of how far a set of variables are from the mean. 
$$
\bf{var(x)} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2} {N}
$$
In the case whereby the variance of a sample is to be computed, the formula changes to:
$$
S^2 = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}
$$
or a simple method:
$$
S^2 = \frac{\sum x_i^2 - \frac{(\sum x_i)^2}{N}} {n-1}
$$

# Covariance
This is the measure of how two similar variables vary together. It is similar to variance the only difference being unlike variance that looks at one variable, covariance looks at two variables.
$$
cov(x,y) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i -\bar{x})(y_i -\bar{y})}{N}
$$
In case of a sample:
$$
S_{xy} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{n-1}
$$
